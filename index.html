            Hi, I'm Mouad Ghouti <img src="https://www.emojibase.com/resources/img/emojis/apple/1f44b.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            As a sophomore computer science student, I have developed a diverse set of skills and experiences that I am excited to share on this website. 
            In addition to my academic achievements, I have also excelled as a varsity basketball player, winning three championships. 
            Furthermore, I have pursued photography as a creative outlet, which has strengthened my ability to think outside the box and approach problems from different angles.
            This website serves as a platform for anyone interested in my work to gain a comprehensive understanding of my abilities and accomplishments.
            I am driven by a passion for computer science and committed to expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. 
            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
